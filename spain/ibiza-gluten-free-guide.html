<p>Ibiza is friendly for gluten-free eating and in most places you will be able to find at least a few options on the menu of most restaurants (e.g. typically meat and veg). As most food eaten there is not fried, there are good chances that the friers are also safe, because they don't use gluten in them. As usual - best to double-check everything.</p>
